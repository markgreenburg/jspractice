/**
Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock.
A higher index indicates a later time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am and $550 at 11:00am, then:

stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;

Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
